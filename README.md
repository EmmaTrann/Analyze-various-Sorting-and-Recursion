Java program that times the execution of three sorting algorithms (radix sort, merge sort, quick sort), reports on the run times and whether the algorithms actually sorted the list

QUESTION 1: In the main function, increase array size from arraySize= 10K,...,50K by 10K at every step and record sorting times (keep the randomization at 25%, i.e., numSwaps = 0.25 Ã— arraySize) for each algorithm. In your report, crate a table (in text, columns separated by the | character ) of times versus array size for each algorithm. The columns of the table will be 1) alg name, 2) arraySize, 3) time (ms).

    No || Alg Name       || Alg Size || Time(ms)

QUESTION 2: Was merge sort (the efficient version) faster than quick sort? Why or why not? Answer the question for arraySize= 10000, number of swaps=2500.

    Quick sort was faster than merge sort (the efficient version). 
    Because merge sort uses extra space for the temporary array, 
    while quick sort is in-place sorting; therefore, quick sort was faster.
 
QUESTION 3: What is the cost of using the inefficient merge sort vs the merge sort? Answer the question for arraySize= 10000, number of swaps=2500.

    The cost of using inefficient merge sort in this case is 3.9905468660000004E7 ms later. 

QUESTION 4: Was radix sort faster than merge sort (the efficient version)? Answer the question for arraySize= 10000, number of swaps=2500.

    Radix sort was faster than merge sort (the efficient version) in this case.
